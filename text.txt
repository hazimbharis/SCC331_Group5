Sprint 4, due week 13 thursday
Website frontend (can be local for this sprint)
-> specific interfaces for specific users (visitors & prison staff)
sensors and data visualisers for:
- location of people (how are people being tracked)
- numbers of people in each building (how many buildings and how do we check)
- enviroment data in each building (this one seems ok)
- extra function (prisoner level)

languages:
MySQL for database

tips:
we should reuse and improve on our code from 330

write this down in a logbook document later
